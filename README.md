# UdacityProject-ChennaiTourGuide

This is my submission to my final Udacity Android Foundation Nanodegree I Project, which was to create a tour guide app on a city of my choice with multiple screens each containing information on a specific category of tourist attractions.

With this project, I was able to gain experience on working on developing android apps and was able to reflect on the knowledge I gained throughout my course.

This version of the project successfully met Udacity's rubrics for the final project.
